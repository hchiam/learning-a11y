# Web accessibility (a11y) notes for the [Udemy course "Creating Accessible Websites"](https://www.udemy.com/course/creating-accessible-websites)

These notes are more for myself as a reference. A good introduction would be to start with [my notes for Google's Udacity course on web accessibility](https://github.com/hchiam/web-accessibility-course-notes).

- [example project I made based off of this course](https://codepen.io/hchiam/pen/ExWLExQ)
- [my certificate of completion](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-55764ea6-40cf-470c-b707-3eae544a4c6a)
- test a11y right when you create a component
- tab = next interactive element
- arrow keys (screenreader) = next element, both interactive or not
- check still usable with 400% zoom
- try bigger font-size if you’re stuck with bad colour contrast
- aria-current=“page” instead of class=“active”
- outline doesn’t affect sizing, border can affect sizing
- hamburger menu icon:
  - button, not a
  - aria-label or actually show “Menu” (since the hamburger icon isn’t skeuomorphic)
  - aria-expanded=“true” (update with JS, open by default if JS disabled)
  - 44px x 44px minimum (WCAG AAA)
- iframe: title=“accessible title when screen reader can’t read image in iframe”
- google maps iframe:
  - title=“123 address” since screen reader can’t read “123 address” in google maps iframe (not even shown in small view, only show location name)
  - add location name + address + directions next to the google maps iframe, since the google maps iframe isn’t very accessible
  - add intersection or landmarks too (we’re in, next to, right after the) = printable
- don’t use placeholder text! just use a separate label
  - low contrast, otherwise black looks populated, and empty is obviously empty to everyone
- HTML5 `<input required>` or `<input aria-required=“true”>`
- don’t just put star next to required fields: first time internet users will be confused
- put aria-hidden=“true” on an svg inside a link just in case some screen readers actually try to read the svg too
- aria-hidden=“true” works, aria-hidden by itself does not work
- avoid using target=“\_blank”
  - if you have to use target=“\_blank” then add rel=“noopener”
  - if you have to use target=“\_blank” then add “(opens in new window)” or new tab icon inside with its own aria-label (will be read too)
    - example: `<a href="#" target="_blank">main link text <span aria-label="(opens in new window)">↗️</span></a>`
- aria-label —> read just the text in aria-label
- aria-describedby —> read text first, then read descriptor element text
- underline = link
- link => underline
- link text should make sense without context: screen reader users may need to skip to links
- `<a href=“/home”><img aria-label=“Homepage”/><a>`
- replace google maps plugin with image on home screen, since google maps plugin might have (2020) bad screen reader experience
- google maps plugin needs better accessibility (2020?)
- test for a11y:
  - tab
  - arrow keys and listen to screen reader
  - lighthouse audit
  - checklist: <https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist>
  - high contrast mode (Edge currently has full support for high contrast mode)
- `<div role=“status” aria-live=“polite”>`
- live region needs to be "visible" for all screen readers to read it (but you can still visually “hide” it with CSS as long as it’s not display none etc)
