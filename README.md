# Learning accessibility (a11y)

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Start with the above link. Extra notes may be added to this repo too.

## Key things I personally focus on most

1. Use [WAVE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) or some other automated a11y checker, like [axe DevTools for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/axe-devtools) or lighthouse or [axe DevTools for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd).
2. Use a [screen reader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R-6WvAihms&list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g&index=7).
3. Tab. Shift+Tab. Enter. (And screen reader + arrow keys.)
